Classic Hearthstone remake
Vanilla + Naxx + GvG + BRM

First demo goal:
Vanilla Zoo mirror.
players in que counter in menu

todo: 
	
message order system
if reached max bits for ushort, maybe add some sort of "cycle counter" in player class that rolls over every "prestige"
TODO: if message fails (index out of range etc..) discard all following messages in que?.

start and end turn confirms to opponent players? //probably not needed


note: minion and spell cards look different.

separate buffs and auras? seems uneeded right now

todo: hand limit + discarding + milling.
todo: aura communication.
todo: valid target exist check for abusive/shattered sun so you can play them with no targets, etc...
