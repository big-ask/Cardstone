Classic Hearthstone remake
Vanilla + Naxx + GvG + BRM

First demo goal:
Vanilla Zoo mirror.
players in que counter in menu

todo: 
	
message order system


start and end turn confirms to opponent players? //probably not needed

note: minion and spell cards look different.

separate buffs and auras? seems uneeded right now

===========================================
class Trigger
{
enum TriggerType
enum TriggerEffect

ActivateTrigger(TriggerType x){
invoke(triggerEffect)
}

}
